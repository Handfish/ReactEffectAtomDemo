# React Interview Test: Queues and Streams

This is a fork of [lucas-barake/react-interview-test-queues-and-streams](https://github.com/lucas-barake/react-interview-test-queues-and-streams) updated to demonstrate an up-to-date example using [@effect-atom/atom-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect-atom/atom-react) with a simple mock server.

## Overview

This project showcases how to use Effect's atom-react library for state management with reactive streams and queues in a React application.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the backend server (no database - just sort of a mock server that stores in memory)
pnpm run server

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- @effect-atom/atom-react
- Mock server for simulating backend interactions
